# 8digitVFDcontroller
A vfd controller and a sample clock I wrote months ago, using a cheap display with integrated controller module.
The display is a C51 STM32 VFD, a cheap (15$) vfd from aliexpress. It has an integrated controller which we are going to send commands to with an arduino.
Therefore, the code is a .ino file. I include two: The one provided by the seller, which apparently isn't available unless you ask them, and a sample code for a clock I wrote.
